# TechieOS
TechieOS is an OS created with the vision of helping coders and developers on the Raspberry Pi.
It is based off Ubuntu 21.04 and is themed and customized to look a little sci-fi and has pi-apps pre-installed to help you install various applications and for ease-of access.
It has Python 3.9 and IDLE pre-installed 
It has all the support from Ubuntu Software and pi-apps
The OS when imstalled on a SD card is about 8 GB..so I have compressed it to a 2.8GB file
The OS has support for auto resizing the partition of the boot drive which you flash it..so you dont need to resize it manually
There is support for USB booting as well..
